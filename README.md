# Config CLI
Config_CLI is an extremely lightweight command line interface to your YAML configuration file.
Just create a yaml config file, and config_CLI will add command line arguments to it automatically.
Suppose you have a YAML file like below:
```
outer:
    x: 0
    inner:
        y:1
        eveninner:
            z: abc
```
then you can use it in the code:
```

```
